# What is devChallenges.io? (https://devchallenges.io/)

- devChallenges.io is a community and a platform for anyone who wants to become a Software Engineer by building real-life projects and solving practical tasks. devChallenges.io is built with the goal of enabling you to build an outstanding portfolio.

- You will find different paths to follow, each path has a set of challenges or projects that you need to complete in order to get a certificate. Paths are designed for you to practice different aspects of Software Development.

- You will also find a roadmap, where I will update new tutorials every week or two. Every tutorial will include task(s) that you can do and submit (come in future releases). You will also find Vlogs, where I will share my advice in the tech industry.

- devChallenges was created by one single person (yeah I know..) and was first released on 1st July 2020.
